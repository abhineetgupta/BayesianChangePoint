# BayesianChangePoint

Change point implementation on spatial Poisson processes : Application to induced seismicity in Oklahoma

The model is described in an in-review paper - Gupta and Baker, Estimating Spatially Varying Event Rates with a Change Point using Bayesian Statistics: Application to Induced Seismicity.
